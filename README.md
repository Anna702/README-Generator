A command-line application that dynamically generates a professional README.md file from a user's input using the [Inquirer package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer).

This CLI app was created to help with creating README.md files for GitHub repositories.
As a part of the IT Bootcamp curriculum requirements, I had to build this application using JavaScript, Node.js and Inquirer package.

## User Story

`AS A developer, I WANT a README generator, SO THAT I can quickly create a professional README for a new project.`

## Installation

To use this application, you will need to have **Node.js** installed on your computer. To start your project smoothly, follow these steps:

- ### Set up .gitignore:

  Begin by creating a .gitignore file in your project's root directory. Include node_modules/ and .DS_Store/ in this file to ensure that your node_modules directory and any .DS_Store files aren't tracked or uploaded to your GitHub repository. It's crucial to create the .gitignore file before installing any npm dependencies.

- ### Initialize package.json:
  Ensure that your repository includes a package.json file with the necessary dependencies listed. You can create a package.json file by running npm init in your project directory. Make sure to do this before installing any dependencies using npm. This step helps manage your project's dependencies and configurations effectively.

## Usage

To use this command-line application, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
3. Run the application by executing the index.js file using Node.js (e.g., `node index.js`).
4. Follow the prompts to input information about your project.
5. Once all information is provided, a high-quality, professional README.md file will be generated automatically.

## Walkthrough Video:

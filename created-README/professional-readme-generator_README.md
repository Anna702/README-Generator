## Description:
A command-line application that dynamically generates a professional README.md file from a user's input using the Inquirer package. 
This CLI app was created to help with creating README.md files for GitHub repositories. As a part of the IT Bootcamp curriculum requirements, I had to build this application using JavaScript, Node.js and Inquirer package.
## User story
```
AS A developer, I WANT a README generator, SO THAT I can quickly create a professional README for a new project.
```
## Installation
To use this application, you will need to have Node.js installed on your computer.

## Usage
Clone the repository. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal. Run the application by executing the index.js file using Node.js (e.g., node index.js). Follow the prompts to input information about your project. Once all information is provided, a high-quality, professional README.md file will be generated automatically.
